# Digital Image Processing (DIP) Course Homeworks

Welcome to my Digital Image Processing (DIP) course homework repository! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of homework assignments from the Spring 2022 semester at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I had the privilege of learning from Professor M. Rahmati and excelled in the implementation aspect of the course, achieving the highest scores.

## Course Structure
The Digital Image Processing course comprised the following components:

- **Homework Assignments**: There were five homework assignments, each covering different topics and challenges related to image processing. These assignments helped me develop practical skills in implementing image processing techniques.

- **Final Project**: The final project was a significant part of the course, allowing me to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve a real-world image processing problem. 

- **Examinations**: The course included a midterm and a final exam to assess my theoretical understanding of the subject.
