Welcome to my Digital Image Processing (DIP) course homework repository! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of homework assignments from the Spring 2022 semester at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I had the privilege of learning from Professor M. Rahmati and excelled in the implementation aspect of the course, achieving the highest scores.

## Overview

In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of Digital Image Processing. I worked on various assignments that enhanced my understanding of image manipulation, enhancement, and analysis. The repository showcases my efforts and solutions throughout the semester.

## Course Structure

The Digital Image Processing course comprised the following components:

- **Homework Assignments**: There were five homework assignments, each covering different topics and challenges related to image processing. These assignments helped me develop practical skills in implementing image processing techniques.

- **Final Project**: The final project was a significant part of the course, allowing me to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve a real-world image processing problem.

- **Examinations**: The course included a midterm and a final exam to assess my theoretical understanding of the subject.

## Homework Assignments

Each homework assignment is organized in its dedicated folder within this repository. Below, you'll find a brief description of each assignment along with the link to its respective folder.

## Final Project

The final project was a culmination of my learning in this course. Unfortunately, the project details are not available in this repository. However, you can reach out to me if you'd like to learn more about it.

## Examinations

To assess my understanding of the course material, I took both a midterm and a final exam. While I can't provide specific details about the exams here, I can share my general experience and study resources upon request.

## How to Use

If you're a student or enthusiast interested in digital image processing, feel free to explore the code and descriptions within this repository. You can use this repository as a reference for your own studies, projects, or as a source of inspiration for image processing techniques.

## Contributing

I'm open to contributions, corrections, and improvements to the code and descriptions. If you have any suggestions or spot any issues, please don't hesitate to create an issue or submit a pull request.
